          <li><h5>Likeability</h5></li>
          <p align='justify'>
            All of us have heard and likely commented, “I like that guy/gal!” The science of likeability says that the smile is the
            biggest key ingredient of liking an individual. Researchers say ability to smile and remain stress free are key markers of a
            successful Interaction. How much and how frequently you smile gives out subtle indication that you are in control of the conversation.
            This should not be confused with laughter. Our algorithms generate proprietary scores that divides this soft skill of Likeability in
            four cohorts as a relative barometer of the candidate's likeability. So how can you be more likeable? Simple, practice delivering the
            answers with smiles as if you are talking to a friend. The top cohort rating (A) on more that 75% of the questions denotes high degree of
            proficiency in this soft skill that should be aimed.
          </p>
          <li><h5>Charm</h5></li>
          <p align='justify'>
            How doesn't want to be charming? Did you know that certain body language markers like eye movement and gazes' signals how charming you appear
            or otherwise? Human resource experts and researchers have discovered that some of these markers can indeed charm the interaction's in your
            favor in a subconscious way. Our algorithms generate proprietary scores that divides this soft skill of Charm in four cohorts as a relative
            barometer of the candidate's charm. This should not be confused with excessive expressions. So how can you improve your scores? Simple, practice
            delivering the answers looking directly at the camera with steady gaze without getting distracted by other elements. The top cohort rating (A)
            on more than 75% of the questions denotes high degree of proficiency in this soft skill that should be aimed.
          </p>
          <li><h5>Confidence</h5></li>
          <p align='justify'>
            Do you use a lot of filler words like “actually”, “really”, “like” and others? Many of us have the habit of doing so in
            our subconscious mind. This creates a negative impression in the minds of the Interactions as if the candidate. Researchers
            have discovered that we often associate the table of “low-confidence” with such candidates. Our algorithms generate
            proprietary scores that divides this soft skill of Confidence in four cohorts as a relative barometer of the candidate's
            confidence. This should not be confused with word play. So how can you improve your scores? Simple, think and answer
            confidently without any filler words. The top cohort rating on more that 75% of the questions denotes high degree of
            proficiency in this soft skill that should be aimed.
          </p>
          <li><h5>Energy</h5></li>
          <p align="justify">
            Ever heard a comment “Wow he was super high energy!” The strength of our voice, voice modulation and pitch matters.
            In makes difficult ideas easy to understand and signals to the interaction's that the candidates know his “stuff”. Our
            algorithms generate proprietary scores that divides this soft skill of energy into four cohorts as a relative barometer
            of the candidate's energy. This should not be confused with merely loud voice. So how can you improve your scores? Simple,
            practice delivering the answers with good voice modulation and pitch range along with a normal voice. The top cohort
            rating (A) on more that 75% of the questions denotes high degree of proficiency in this soft skill, that should be aimed.
          </p>
          <li><h5>Fluency</h5></li>
          <p align="justify">
            We all want to sound fluent in the Interactions but whether due to the pressure or tension, we tend to fumble with words
            and take long awkward pauses. This is exactly opposite to a rock star candidate who always appear to be fluent. Our
            algorithms generate proprietary scores that divides this soft skill of fluency into four cohorts as a relative barometer
            of the candidate's fluency. This should not be confused with merely rapid speech. So how can you improve your scores?
            Simple, practice delivering the answers with which are well thought out. Request for a minute to formulate your answers
            before you start speaking so that unnecessary pauses can be avoided. The top cohort rating (A) on more that 75% of the
            questions denotes high degree of proficiency in this soft skill, that should be aimed.
